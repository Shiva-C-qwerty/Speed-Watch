# SpeedWatch: Automated Overspeed Detection and Analysis

SpeedWatch is an advanced computer vision project that automatically detects the speed of cars and tags them as overspeeding. It utilizes computer vision techniques to analyze video footage from cameras placed on roads or highways. The project then performs in-depth analysis on the overspeeding data, providing valuable insights and statistics.

## Features

- **Real-time Overspeed Detection:** The system uses computer vision algorithms to accurately detect and track vehicles, determining their speed in real-time.
- **Overspeed Tagging:** Detected overspeeding vehicles are automatically tagged and recorded for further analysis.
- **Data Analysis:** The project performs analysis on the overspeeding data, generating statistics such as average speed, peak hours, and frequency of overspeeding events.

Please refer to the detailed documentation in the repository for more information on configuration options, API integration, and customization.
